<hr /> 

<h3>Ironman</h3>
<p>This was a really great action movie and shows off a TON of cool tech and CG. Whats not to love. That and the character development with Tony Stark across the following films was so good!</p>

<h3>千と千尋の神隠し ”Spirited Away”</h3>
<p>My favorite Ghibili Movie, just watch and you will see why.</p>

<h3>君の名は "Your Name"</h3>
<p>I may have cried... just a bit.</p>
